      'Nothing seemed out of the ordinary on the street of Private Drive, until a figure suddenly appeared. Quite far from ordinary, this old man was dressed in purple robes and a pointed hat, with half-moon glasses on his crooked nose. From his robe pocket he pulled out a lighter. With a pop, every streetlight went out, plunging the street into darkness.',

      'A bright light in the sky was seemingly coming straight for the old man. It was a motorbike, ridden by an enormous, bushy-haired man holding a bundle of blankets. "Good evening, Professor Dumbledore, sir," he greeted as he dismounted. "Good evening, Hagrid," Dumbledore replied.',

      '"He fell asleep as soon as we were in the air, poor little tyke," said Hagrid. Dumbledore gently unwrapped part of the blanket, revealing a sleeping baby boy with dark hair and a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. "He\’ll be alright, won\’t he, sir?" Hagrid asked, sounding worried. "They\'re his only family; we have no choice," Dumbledore replied.',

      '“He\’ll be famous,” Dumbledore murmured with a faint frown, “there won\’t be a soul in our world who doesn\’t know his name. That isn\’t the life I\’d wish for him.” He paused, looking at the sleeping baby. “Good luck, Harry Potter,” he whispered softly. Hagrid wiped his eyes as they both turned to leave, leaving Harry on the doorstep, unaware of the future that awaited him.',

That\’s right—his bedroom was nothing more than a cramped, dim closet under the staircase. His aunt and uncle weren\’t exactly fond of him, and they seemed to think this arrangement was fitting.',
